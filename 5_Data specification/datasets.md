# Data Specification

## Dataset 1: Air Quality Measurements (2010–2013)
**Title:** metriseis_atmosfairikis_rypansis_dimotikoy_diktyoy_2010_2013  
**Description:** This dataset contains daily air-pollution measurements recorded by the municipal monitoring network of the City of Thessaloniki during 2010–2013. It includes concentrations for major pollutants such as SO₂, NO₂, NO, O₃, PM10, PM2.5, and CO. The data were collected from six fixed monitoring stations (Εγνατίας, 25ης Μαρτίου, Λαγκαδά, Επταπυργίου, Μαλακοπής, Νέου Δημαρχείου) and serve as the main input for environmental exposure analysis and policy evaluation.

**Format:** Excel (.xlsx)  
**Key Fields:** Date, Station, Pollutant, Value

## Dataset 2: Resident Population (Census 2011)
**Title:** resident_population_census2011_Thessaloniki_metropolitan  
**Description:** Official demographic data derived from the 2011 Population and Housing Census by the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT). It reports the permanent resident population of each municipal community within the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area and serves as the demographic baseline for calculating per-capita pollution indicators.  
**Source:** (TDS) Thessaloniki Data Space [https://tds.okfn.gr/dataset/209]  
**Format:** Excel (.xlsx)  
**Key Fields:** Municipal_Community, Population

## Dataset 3: Extended Population Dataset (Negotiated Access)
**Title:** resident_population_census2011-extended thessaloniki  
**Description:** Refined population dataset created under the MDAT pilot following a negotiation process between the Data Provider (ELSTAT) and the Researcher. It provides higher spatial granularity (sub-municipal subdivisions) to enable more accurate mapping between monitoring stations and population exposure areas. This dataset is distributed under controlled access and includes unique geographic codes per subunit.  
**Source:** Internal Data Provision – Negotiated Access (MDAT)  
**Format:** Excel (.xlsx)  
**Key Fields:** Subunit, Population, Geographic_Code

## Dataset 4: Atmospheric Analysis Results
**Title:** atmospheric_analysis_thessaloniki  
**Description:** Analytical output dataset generated by the Python workflow **Thessaloniki_AirQuality_Workflow.py**. It integrates the air-pollution and extended population datasets to compute average pollutant concentrations (2010–2013), check compliance with WHO/EU limits, and calculate exposure indicators such as *Pollution per Capita* and the *Air Pollution Index per Capita (API_pc)*.  
**Source:** Local analysis script (Thessaloniki_AirQuality_Workflow.py)  
**Format:** Excel (.xlsx)  
**Key Fields:** Pollutant, Mean_2010_2013, Population, Pollution_per_Capita, Compliance_Status

**Note:**  
All datasets follow the **Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV 2.2)** and **MDAT domain ontology** for semantic interoperability.  
Dataset 3 is categorized as *restricted access (controlled reuse)*, while Dataset 4 represents *derived analytical results* produced locally.
